# Adventure-Game-
In this project, I have made a simpler version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. The game will present you some scenarios and ask you to make one of 2 choices, by entering 1 or 2.The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice. Something different happens depending on the choice the player made. The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time. The game has conditions for winning and losing. When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
